# Lizard Advice

Lizard advice is a simple app that returns either a Kanye West tweet or a generic advice. The return is based on the astrological sign selected by the user, but the user is also prompted to ask the lizard an open ended question when they open the modal. The lizard either wears a crown or does not wear a crown.

Think Magic 8 Ball, but for people who prefer lizards.
